      <description>NOTE: This post is an parody in the same genre as How to Burn Money and Computing Power for a Simple Median.
This post was generated using the same code as in the previous post, but with the prompt:
Write a post in the style of Towards Data Science about the following code. Keep in mind that this code is showing how to estimate an unconditional median using a deep learning model.</description>

      <description>Today, we dive into the comedic world of absurdly over-engineered solutions for simple problems. Our target? Calculating a mean or median using R and TensorFlow in what might be the most hilariously unnecessary method ever conceived.
Overkill Environment Setup First things first: setting up our R environment. Sure, we could go easy with dplyr and ggplot2, but where’s the fun in that? Instead, let’s summon the computational titans - keras and tensorflow.</description>
