      This is largely a note to my past-self on how to easily use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian inference when the parameter you are interested in has bounded support. The most basic MCMC methods involve using additive noise to get new draws, which can cause problems if that kicks you out of the parameter space.
Suggestions abound to use the transformation trick on a bounded parameter \(\theta\), and then make draws of the transformed parameter.

      For those who ended up here looking for information about quantum statistical mechanics or particle statistics: apologies! But sometimes I feel like physicists took all the exciting names, so I’m stealing the term quanta as it relates to an observable that can take on only discrete (not continuous values). That has interesting consequences for inferential procedures based on such discrete (“quantum”) statistics, as we will see in this post.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last time, we saw that when performing a hypothesis test with a discrete test statistic, we will typically lose size unless we happen to be very lucky and have the significance level \(\alpha\) exactly match one of our possible \(P\)-values. In this post, I will introduce a randomized hypothesis test that will regain the size we lost. Unlike a lot of randomization in statistics, the randomization here comes at the end: we randomize the \(P\)-value in order to recover the size.
